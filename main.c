 *
 * This is a small program written in c that monitors the CPU temperature,
 * turns on an installed fan if the temperature reaches a set limit, then turns
 * the fan back off when the temperature drops below a second set limit.
 *
 * There is no configuration file or command line flags, all options must be
 * set before compiling. See Below.
